A teacher has finished grading their students tests and needs your help to:

1. Calculate the average score for the class.
2. Converting the student score to a letter grade.
   Here are the scores and their corresponding letter grades:
   Score Range Grade
   100 "A++"
   90 - 99 "A"
   80 - 89 "B"
   70 - 79 "C"
   60 - 69 "D"
   0 - 59 "F"
3. Check if a student has a passing grade (A passing grade is anything that is not an "F").
4. Message the student with the results
